				Longer-term mechanical circulatory assist will provide an improved
				quality of life for thousands of pediatric patients per year in the
				United States who suffer from ventricular failure secondary to
				acquired or congenital heart disease. There are currently very few
				mechanical circulatory support systems available as viable
				bridge-to-transplant or recovery alternatives.
				</p>
				<p>To address this substantial need, we are developing
					alternative biodevices to augment circulatory flow and pressure in
					these pediatric patients with biventricular or univentricular
					physiology. Noninvasive, minimally invasive, and invasive
					technologies are being designed, developed, and evaluated in this
					laboratory.</p>
				<p>
				Our research group constitutes an ideal multidisciplinary team to
				carry out this line of research and bench-to-bedside device
				development. These biomechanical devices will become an effective
				therapeutic option for thousands of infants and children suffering
				from heart failure in the United States - ultimately saving lives
				and addressing a significant human health problem.

							The BioCirc Lab is located in the state-of-the-art Edmund D. Bossone Research Enterprise Center in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems at Drexel University. Located in downtown Philadelphia, this urban academic and research facility provides cutting edge resources, producing research at the forefront of technology. The155,000-square-foot multistory has 48 teaching laboratories, 37 lab support spaces, 77 offices, and a 300-seat auditorium.  The BioCirc Lab consists of a 600 square foot lab space that is equipped with instrumentation and equipment to conduct computer modeling, experimental testing of prototypes, hemolysis testing, and statistical analyses of data acquired in the development of innovative treatment options for pediatric and adult patients with heart failure. </p>
